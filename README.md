# Jenkins Foundations – KodeKloud Labs

This repository contains my hands-on introduction to Jenkins through KodeKloud labs. I also explored the work from a **GRC perspective**, linking practical Jenkins tasks to governance, risk, and compliance lessons.

---

## Key Hands-On Activities

- Familiarized myself with the **Jenkins interface**  
- Installed **Jenkins on a virtual machine**  
- Used the **Jenkins CLI** for automation and management  
- Installed the **ThinBackup plugin** and performed **backup & restore** of configurations  
- Built a **Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline**

## Key Lessons Learned

- Understanding Jenkins user management, plugin updates, and pipeline configuration is critical from a **GRC viewpoint**  
- Backup and restore practices are essential to ensure **recovery and compliance**  
- Automating tasks via CLI reduces human error and supports **secure operations**
